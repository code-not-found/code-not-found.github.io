Following tutorials will help you learn [gRPC Java](https://github.com/grpc/grpc-java){:target="_blank"} in record time.

The best part?

They all come with **detailed explanations**, source code, and accompanying test cases.

So let's fire away.

## 1. What Is gRPC?

[gRPC](https://grpc.io/){:target="_blank"} is a high performance, open-source universal [RPC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Remote_procedure_call){:target="_blank"} framework. By default it uses Protocol Buffers to define exposed services.

The framework provides features such as bidirectional streaming. It has support for many [different programming languages](https://grpc.io/faq/){:target="_blank"} including Java.

gRPC [was initially developed at Google](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC){:target="_blank"} and is now licensed under Apache 2.0.
