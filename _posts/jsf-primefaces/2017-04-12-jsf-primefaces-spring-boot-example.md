[JoinFaces](http://primefaces.org/) is an open source component library for JavaServer Faces (JSF). It provides a collection of mostly visual components (widgets) that can be used by JSF programmers to build the UI for a web application. An overview of these widgets can be found at the [PrimeFaces showcase](http://www.primefaces.org/showcase/). In the following tutorial we will configure, build and run a Hello World PrimeFaces example using Jetty and Maven.

Tools used:
* JSF 2.2
* PrimeFaces 6.0
* Jetty 9
* Maven 3
