Information on the root XML element is required when **marshalling** to or **unmarshalling** from a Java object. JAXB provides this information via the `@XmlRootElement` annotation which contains the name and namespace of the root XML element.

When trying to marshal a class which does not have a `@XMLRootElement` annotation defined, following error will be thrown: <var>"unable to marshal as an element because it is missing an @XmlRootElement annotation"</var>. Alternatively, when trying to unmarshal, the Java runtime will report that an <var>"unsuspected element"</var> is found.

For this example let's use following class representing a car with a basic structure. Note that a `XmlRootElement` is not defined!

``` java
package com.codenotfound.jaxb.model;

import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlAttribute;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlElement;

public class Car {

  private String make;
  private String manufacturer;
  private String id;

  public String getMake() {
    return make;
  }

  @XmlElement
  public void setMake(String make) {
    this.make = make;
  }

  public String getManufacturer() {
    return manufacturer;
  }

  @XmlElement
  public void setManufacturer(String manufacturer) {
    this.manufacturer = manufacturer;
  }

  public String getId() {
    return id;
  }

  @XmlAttribute
  public void setId(String id) {
    this.id = id;
  }

  @Override
  public String toString() {
    return "Car [" + "make=" + make + ", manufacturer=" + manufacturer + ", id=" + id + "]";
  }
}
```

# Marshal when @XMLRootElement is missing

Marshalling is the process of transforming the memory representation of an object to a data format suitable for storage or transmission. In the case of JAXB, it means converting a Java object into XML. The below code snippet shows the creation of a new `Car` instance.
``` java
  car = new Car();
  car.setMake("Passat");
  car.setManufacturer("Volkswagen");
  car.setId("ABC-123");
```

The method below takes as input the above car object and tries to marshal it using JAXB.

``` java
public static String marshalError(Car car) throws JAXBException {
  StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();

  JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Car.class);
  Marshaller jaxbMarshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();

  // format the XML output
  jaxbMarshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);

  jaxbMarshaller.marshal(car, stringWriter);

  String result = stringWriter.toString();
  LOGGER.info(result);
  return result;
}
```

When running the above method, the runtime returns an error as the `Car` class is missing the required `@XMLRootElement` annotation.

``` plaintext
unable to marshal type "com.codenotfound.jaxb.model.Car" as an
element because it is missing an @XmlRootElement annotation
```

In order to be able to marshal the car object, we need to provide a root XML element. This is done as shown below by first creating a qualified name which contains the name and namespace of the root XML element. In a next step, we create a new `JAXBElement` and pass the qualified name, class and, object. Using the created `JAXBElement` we call the `marshal()` method.

``` java
public static String marshal(Car car) throws JAXBException {
  StringWriter stringWriter = new StringWriter();

  JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Car.class);
  Marshaller jaxbMarshaller = jaxbContext.createMarshaller();

  // format the XML output
  jaxbMarshaller.setProperty(Marshaller.JAXB_FORMATTED_OUTPUT, true);

  QName qName = new QName("com.codenotfound.jaxb.model", "car");
  JAXBElement<Car> root = new JAXBElement<>(qName, Car.class, car);

  jaxbMarshaller.marshal(root, stringWriter);

  String result = stringWriter.toString();
  LOGGER.info(result);
  return result;
}
```

This time JAXB is able to successfully marshal the object and the result is the following:

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:car id="ABC-123" xmlns:ns2="com.codenotfound.jaxb.model">
  <make>Passat</make>
  <manufacturer>Volkswagen</manufacturer>
</ns2:car>
```

# Unmarshal when @XMLRootElement is missing

Unmarshalling in JAXB is the process of converting XML content into a Java object. Let's reuse the XML representation of a car that we generated in the previous section.

``` xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" standalone="yes"?>
<ns2:car id="DEF-456" xmlns:ns2="com.codenotfound.jaxb.model">
  <make>Golf</make>
  <manufacturer>Volkswagen</manufacturer>
</ns2:car>
```

In the method below we pass the above XML file and try to unmarshal it to an instance of the `Car` class. Note that it is also possible to [use JAXB to create an object from an XML String]({{ site.url }}/jaxb-unmarshal-xml-string-into-java-object.html) instead of using a file.

``` java
public static Car unmarshalError(File file) throws JAXBException {
  JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Car.class);
  Unmarshaller jaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();

  Car car = (Car) jaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(file);

  LOGGER.info(car.toString());
  return car;
}
```

When running the above code, the runtime returns an error as a root XML element is found (the XML has a root element) but the `Car` class does not define a `@XMLRootElement` and as such it is not expected.

``` plaintext
unexpected element (uri:"com.codenotfound.jaxb.model", local:"car").
Expected elements are (none)
```

In order to be able to unmarshal the object, we need to define a root XML element. This is done as shown below by first manually creating the root `JAXBElement` of type `Car` by using the XML file and the class we are trying to unmarshal to. Then we create a `Car` object and assign the value of the previous created root `JAXBElement`.

``` java
public static Car unmarshal(File file) throws JAXBException {
  JAXBContext jaxbContext = JAXBContext.newInstance(Car.class);
  Unmarshaller jaxbUnmarshaller = jaxbContext.createUnmarshaller();

  JAXBElement<Car> root = jaxbUnmarshaller.unmarshal(new StreamSource(
            file), Car.class);
  Car car = root.getValue();

  LOGGER.info(car.toString());
  return car;
}
```

This time JAXB is able to successfully unmarshal the object and the result is the following:

``` plaintext
Car [make=Golf, manufacturer=Volkswagen, id=DEF-456]
```
