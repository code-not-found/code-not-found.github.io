This one might be an obvious pick but the Spring Team maintains a blog.

It contains the newest releases of the different Spring frameworks. You'll also find several tutorials and detailed how-to guides. As well as announcements and the latest news and events around the Spring community.

Our favorite post(s): The This week in Spring posts by [Josh Long](https://spring.io/team/jlong){:target="_blank"}.
