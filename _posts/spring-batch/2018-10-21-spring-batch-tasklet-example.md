Want to know what a _Spring Batch Tasklet_ is?

And more important: **when to use it?**

Then you’re in the right place.

Because today I’m going to show you a detailed example.

Let’s do this!

## What is a Spring Batch Tasklet?

Spring Batch offers two different ways for **implementing a step of a batch job**:
* using [chunks](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/4.0.x/reference/html/step.html#chunkOrientedProcessing){:target="_blank"}
* using a [tasklet](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/4.0.x/reference/html/step.html#taskletStep){:target="_blank"}

In our [Spring Batch Job example]({{ site.url }}/spring-batch-hello-world-example.html) we saw that a batch job consists out of one or more `Step`s. A `Tasklet` represents the work that is done in a `Step`. It contains the strategy for processing in a `Step`.

A [Tasklet](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch/trunk/apidocs/org/springframework/batch/core/step/tasklet/Tasklet.html){:target="_blank"} is in fact a simple interface that has one method: `execute()`. A `Step` calls this method repeatedly until it either finishes or throws an exception.

Spring Batch contains a number of implementations of the `Tasklet` interface. One of them is a chunk oriented processing `Tasklet`.

In this tutorial you also learned the difference between a `Tasklet` and a `Chunk`. We also created a Tasklet example using Spring Batch.
