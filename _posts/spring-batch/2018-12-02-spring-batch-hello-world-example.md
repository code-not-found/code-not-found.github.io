I’m going to show you exactly how to create a [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch){:target="_blank"} Hello World example that uses [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/){:target="_blank"} and [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot){:target="_blank"}.

(Step-by-step)

So if you’re a Spring Batch beginner, **you’ll love this guide**.

Let’s dive right in…

## How Does the Spring Batch Framework Work?

Before we dive into the code let's look at how the Spring Batch framework works. It contains following key concepts:

<img src="{{ site.url }}/assets/images/spring-batch/spring-batch-framework.png" alt="spring batch framework">

A batch process consists out of a `Job`. This is an entity that encapsulates the entire batch process.

A `Job` can consist out of one or more `Step`s. In most cases a step will read data (`ItemReader`), process it (`ItemProcessor`) and then write it(`ItemWriter`).

The `JobLauncher` is responsible for launching a `Job`.

And finally the `JobRepository` stores metadata about configured and executed `Job`s.

## General Project Setup

To demonstrate how Spring Batch works we will build a simple Hello World batch job.

We will read person data from a CSV file. From this data a greeting is generated. This greeting is then written to a text file.
