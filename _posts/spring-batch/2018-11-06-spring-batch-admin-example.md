Looking for a [Spring Batch Admin](https://docs.spring.io/spring-batch-admin/trunk/){:target="_blank"} UI tutorial?

You might be surprised to learn it is no longer supported.

Don't worry as in this post **I'll show you the recommended replacement**. And how to set it up.

Letâ€™s dive right in.

## What is Spring Batch Admin?

Spring Batch Admin provides a user interface that allows you to manage batch jobs. The project is **end of life since December 31, 2017**.

[Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-dataflow/){:target="_blank"} is now the recommended replacement for managing and monitoring [Spring Batch](https://spring.io/projects/spring-batch){:target="_blank"} jobs.

Let's demonstrate how Spring Cloud Data Flow works in combination with Spring Batch.

We start from a basic [Spring Batch capitalize names](https://github.com/code-not-found/spring-batch/tree/master/spring-batch-capitalize-names){:target="_blank"} project that converts person names from lower case into upper case.

We then start a Spring Cloud Data Flow server and configure the batch job. Using the web-based UI we launch the job and monitor the status.

## General Project Setup

> [Spring Cloud Data Flow](https://github.com/spring-cloud/spring-cloud-dataflow){:target="_blank"} does not yet support Spring Boot 2.0. That is why this example uses Spring Boot 1.5 and Spring Batch 3.0.

We will use the following tools/frameworks:
* _Spring Batch 3.0_
* _Spring Boot 1.5_
* _Maven 3.5_

We will create two Maven projects have the following structure:
